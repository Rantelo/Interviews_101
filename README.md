# Programming Interviews 101
In this repository we will be posting sample problems for you to practice. We have added you all as contributors (if we forgot someone, feel free to add them) so you can push your changes. The idea is for you to create your own branch and work on the problems, after everyone has come up with a solution and pushed it, we will discuss and choose which of the solutions are better and merge them into master. 

This will also allow you to look at your peers' work, be it to help them or to be helped by them, which is great since you'll be working in teams during the competition. However, we advise you to really work on the problems on your own before you start looking at other people's code.

The problem set is organized as follows:
- Each folder is named after a problem
- Inside each folder you will find:
    - problem_name.txt: A brief description of the problem and what the expected inputs and outputs are
    - inputs: A folder containing a set of sample inputs with which you can test your solutions
    - outputs: A folder containing the expected outputs corresponding to the tests found in the inputs folder. Our solutions are not perfect, so you might find that there are some mistakes in our output. Please let us know. Preferably, open an issue and explain it.
    - hint[n].txt: You may find several of these files inside the folder. These contain hints that will point you to the right solution

We will use GitHub issues feature to post questions or doubts you might have about the problems and also for posting corrections to errors you might find in the provided inputs and outputs
