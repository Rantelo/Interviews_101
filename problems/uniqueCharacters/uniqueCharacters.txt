Determine whether a string contains only unique characters
For example:
	abcdefg does contain only unique characters,
	wheras aba doesn't (as it contains a twice)
You are assured that you will only get ASCII characters

NOTE: You should be able to do this using either O(1) or O(n)
space. Try implementing both and think of why you would choose
one over the other

Input:
A line containing a number n
A line containing a number s indicating the size of the string
to be checkd followed by the string itself

For example:

3
5 abcde
8 ancnejfjq
10 mcgjqisuryl


Output:
A line containing yes or no for every of the n strings in the input

For the previous example:

yes
no
yes
