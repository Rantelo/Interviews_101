You are given a grid that represents a map of a geographic
each cell in the grid contains either land or sea. Your job
is to determine how many islands exist in said map.

For example:

-------------
| L | S | L |
| L | L | S |
| L | S | L |
-------------
L: Land
S: Sea

In this map we have 3 islands. The first column and the middle
cell form one island and the other two L cells make the rest.

NOTE: The grid is not necessarily a square

Input:
A line containing a number n
n of the following:
	A line containing two numbers a and b which represent the size of the grid (a rows and b columns)
	a lines containing b 0s or 1s where 1s 0s represent a sea cell and 1s represent land cells

For example:

3
3 3
1 0 1
1 1 0
1 0 1
2 3
1 1 0
0 0 1
5 2
0 1
1 0
1 1
0 1
1 1

Output:
A line containing the number of islands for each of the inputs.
For the previous example, you should output:

3
2
2
