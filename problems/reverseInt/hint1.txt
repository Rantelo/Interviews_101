Think how you would approach the problem if instead of giving you
the number as an integer, we gave you an array containing each of
its digits. For example:
	Instead of 101, [1, 0, 1]

As mentioned in the description you only are allowed to use O(1)
space, but think how could you iterate over the digits of the input
similarly as how you would an array
