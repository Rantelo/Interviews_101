Reverse the digits of an integer. For example:
	2015 -> 5102
	738  -> 837
You should do this using O(1) extra memory (i.e. don't turn it into a string)

Input:
A line containing a number n
n lines containing the numbers to be reversed
For example:

5
123
-5030
2015
739
1504393

Output:
A line containing the reversed numbers
For the previous example, you should output:

321
-305
5102
937
3934051
