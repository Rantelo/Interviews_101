Your task is to implement an hex adder. You will be given
two unsingned integers as strings of their hex representation
and you should output another string containing the hex
representation of their sum.

There are no restrictions to the size on the size on the input
other than both values and their sum should be able to fit in
memory (as strings). So, for large values, you might not be able
to turn them into actual ints

NOTE: All strings will be using lowercase letters

Input:
A line contaning a single number n
n lines containing two strings representing the numbers to be
added

For example:
3
a b
1 2b
12 3a

Output:
n lines containing the sum of both the numbers on each line

For the previous example:
15
2c
4c
