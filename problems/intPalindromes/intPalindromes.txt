Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. For example
	10 is not a palindrome
	101 is a palindrome
	1991 is a plindrome
	5 is a palindrome
	11 is a palindrome
Assume you will only get unsigned values. You must do this 
using O(1) extra space (i.e. don't turn it into a string)

Input:
A line containing a sigle number n
n lines containing test cases. For example:

5
10
101
1991
5
11

Output:
n lines containing 'yes' or 'no' according to whether the
corresponding number is a palindrome. For example:

no
yes
yes
yes
yes
