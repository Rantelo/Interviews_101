Your task is to implement a function called stockPicker which takes as input an array of integers
which are meant to represent the price of a stock throughout a period of time (A[i] represents the
price of the stock in day i) and outputs a pair of days which would yield the best profit to someone
looking to buy the stock. For example:
	[17,3,6,9,15,8,6,1,10]
	For this input, we should output [1, 4] for buying in day 1 (prices is 3) and selling in day 4
	(price is 15) would give us a profit of 12

Input:
A text file which contains a single number n in its first line. This number indicates the number of 
price sets that will be provided. The following n lines contain a list of space separated integers
the first of which indicates the size of the price set, the rest represent the actual price set.
For the previous example the file would contain:

1
9 17 3 6 9 15 8 6 1 10

Output
You should output a line containing the following values separated by spaces for each price set in the
input file: the maximized profit, the index of the buy day and the index of the sell day. So, for the previous
input file, you should output:

12 1 4

Notes:
In some instances, there are multiple correct answers, the provided outputs do not consider all of them so if you
find a mismatch with your output verify that the profits match and that your buy and sell days actually yield said
profit
